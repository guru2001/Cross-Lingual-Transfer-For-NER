CROSS LINGUAL TRANSFER FOR NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION:-
Named Entity Recognition:
NER is a task in Information Extraction consisting in identifying and classifying just some types of information elements ,called Named Entities (NE) for example person , Location , Organisation , Association , Facilities , Material , Time , Date , Designation etc.

Crosslingual transfer:
Cross lingual transfer (i.e. transfer from the mother tongue or any other previously learned language) in foreign language learning
Here Source is Hindi and target is English .
Considered word level mapping only
It is important to recognize NER cause
->The information transfer of sentences would increase. 
It helps us in -
->Efficient search engines.
->Giving better results for news providers regarding about which person or organisation is news about.

DATA USED:
->Raw parallel corpus of 4316 lines English and Hindi were taken to transfer features from Hindi to English as data based on judiciary NER.
(english and hindi)
->A Hindi file with the mapping of NER or not an NER(o) test_file
(judicial-NER-final.txt)
->Took a parallel corpus of 37,729 lines of English and Hindi to find more accurately the word alignments for better performance of NER. 
(training.hi-en.en and training.hi-en.hi)

USE OF GIZA++:
->GIZA++ is a tool used to find word alignments.
->Used GIZA++ to find the word alignment between English and Hindi of the big corpus data for more accuracy in alignments.Some of the alignments
तुक्रिया Tukriya		झीलें lakes	   संगमर्मर marble	सफलता success
पोल Pol			राहें paths	ब्रह्मांडीय cosmic	पशुओं animals
सम्भवत Probable	247 247	(२) (2)	विनाश्न Vinashn
->Made a dictionary with the Hindi word as Key and value as English word mapped.Only considered alignments having greater than 0.6.
->Found the corresponding English train_data by using the dictionary.(1.py dictionary - d)
(Commands in giza.txt)

CRF:-
->CRF is a statistical model used for segmenting sequential data.
RUNNING CRF ON HINDI DATA:
Created a template_file considering only the present word
Template file: template_hin
Training Data has 2345 words starting of the NER mapping file.
Testing Data has 12470 words ending of the NER mapping file.
ACCURACY : 95.87% (report=eval-report-hin-ner-test and crf_output in pred-hin-ner and model genrated in model-hin-ner)
(commands in crf.txt)

RUNNING CRF ON ENGLISH DATA:
->Created template ,considering current,next,next’s next and previous words.
Template_file(template_hin)
->Training data has 12470 words obtained by getting the values from corresponding keys obtained from train-ner-hin if there is not present in dictionary the value is taken as NULL in train-ner-eng.
->Testing data has 2345 words obtained by translating(GOOGLE TRANSLATE) test-ner-hin in test-ner-eng.
ACCURACY - 77.53% (report=eval-report-eng-ner-test and crf_output in pred-eng-ner and model generated in model-eng-ner)

ERROR ANALYSIS(error.txt):
->The alignments are correct up to certain accuracy so the training data is not 100% correct.
->It is not recognizing the Named Entities separated by spaces.
->Failed to recognize many numbers and years.

IMPROVING ACCURACY:
->If number of iterations in GIZA++ to a certain level to obtain maximum accuracy is increased then the word alignments would be better and hence the train-ner-eng would be better crosslingual transfer.
->If we include additional features in template file accuracy may increase.
